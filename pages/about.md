My name is Jonathan, and I'm just one more curious human. I like to make things. I make games. I paint. I'm a baker and a magician. I am of the opinion that you can't have too many hobbies, and that you should try everything at least once.

I'm not amazing at everything I try, but like Jake from Adventure Time says, "Sucking at something is the fist step to being sorta' good at something."
