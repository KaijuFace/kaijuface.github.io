I've finally updated this website with some things. It looks mostly like a website, now. I've given it the name **Works in Progress**, which is the name I've given every personal site I've made for myself since 1998. This is comfortable for me.<!--more--> This also accomplishes two seemigly minor but actually major steps in my recent journey:
- First, it gets me back into tackling challenging tasks and following-through without giving up. Getting to this stage of this website was kind of a pain in the ass, for me.
- Second, having completed step one, I now have a place to document the other things I'm working on in a way that holds me accountable to others, when needed.

### So what am I doing?

I have some ambitions for the future of this site, and for projects I've started (or want to start). In no particular order, here's some things to look forward to:
- A Portfolio section on the website, to show off my projects
- A mailing list, so that anyone interested can get updates on the site when they become available
- More work on the game I've started making, and documentation so you can see it here
- Lots of other things, which will hopefully all end up on this site at some point

I still have so much I want to do, but this feels like a good start.

This post's photo is one I took at a recent concert.
